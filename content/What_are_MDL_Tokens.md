MDL Tokens are a virtual something that you can buy, which allows you to pay and get paid on MDL Talent Hub. If you own, buy or receive an MDL Token you can choose to pay or buy something on the MDL Talent Hub platform or to cash out the value of that token into a currency of your choice (Euro, Dollar, BTC, ETH, etc.). MDL Tokens also produce Token Hours, which function as a sort of interest on the MDL Talent Hub platform.
