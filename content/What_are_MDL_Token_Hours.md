Token Hours are a sort of interest which you receive hourly, if you own MDL Tokens. Holding 1 MDL Token will earn you 1 Token Hour each hour. Holding 100 MDL Tokens will earn you 100 Token Hours each hour. With these token hours you can benefit from discounts on the platform when buying something but also when paying someone. This means that in-app purchases would be cheaper when using MDL Tokens, because you have reduced transaction fees when using MDL Token Hours. Paying someone would also be less costly because you would also have reduced transaction fees.
