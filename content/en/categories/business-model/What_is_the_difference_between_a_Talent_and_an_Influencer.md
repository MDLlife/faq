Both a talent and an influencer can be a performer such as an actor, singer, dancer, model, etc. the difference is that a talent, is focusing mainly on offline performances and doesn't necessarily have an online presence and an Influencer is focussing mostly on increasing their online presence. A talent will work more on creating offline materials while an influencer will work more on creating online exposure..
