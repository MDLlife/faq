The marketplace-ecosystem is a part of the MDL Talent Hub platform that allows talents to set up their own webshop and sell to their fans, allow talents to rent and sell equipment to other talents and allows brands to sell products at discounted rates to talents, where discounts are calculated based on their amount of followers. -> This allows beginning talents to buy very affordable products which then in turn will get promoted whenever they perform.
