Holding 100 MDL Tokens will earn you 100 Token Hours each hour. With these token hours you can benefit from discounts on the platform when buying something but also when paying someone. This means that in-app purchases would be cheaper when using MDL Tokens, because you have reduced transaction fees when using MDL Token Hours.</description>
